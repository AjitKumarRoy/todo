# Todo App

A simple and responsive Todo List Application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks, which are stored locally using **localStorage**, so your tasks persist even after you reload the page.

## Features

- Add new todo items by typing in the input field and hitting "Enter" or clicking the "Add" button.
- Edit or delete existing todo items.
- Todos are saved in localStorage, meaning they will stay even after refreshing the page.
- Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
